# EE403Project_Equalizer
This repository is to show the code that my group and I used to realize our graphical equalizer for our senior design class here at Penn State. 

The software used was the Keil uvision program using the language C. 
The graphical libarary, eGFX, was used to draw both the sliders and the equzlizer bands. The source code called main.c is up on the server. This basically shows the archetectiure of the software. The proejct itself had many more scripts, linking perhical to mmeory locations and using the CMSIS DAP math libraries. 

If you have any questions, feel free to messege me and I'll do my best to answer them.
